## ‚ùì Open Questions & Decisions

### Pending Decisions
- [ ] **Documentation Schema**: What specific structure does Intercom's Fin require?
- [ ] **Quality Metrics**: How do we measure "high quality" documentation?
- [ ] **Batch Operations**: Should we support bulk document generation?
- [ ] **Permissions**: How do we handle Notion/Slack access permissions?
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Should we cache fetched Notion/Slack content?

### Technical Considerations
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: How to handle API rate limits gracefully?
- [ ] **Large Documents**: Maximum document size constraints?
- [ ] **Concurrent Editing**: How to handle multiple users editing?
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Should we support offline editing?

## üìù Decision Log

### Agreed Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-01-20 | Use GPT-5 for main model | Superior quality, built-in reasoning | Higher cost but better output |
| 2025-01-20 | Keep MCP for external integrations | Separation of concerns, easier maintenance | Need to handle MCP server availability |
| 2025-01-20 | Modal UI for selection | Better UX than inline selection | Additional UI components needed |

### Implementation Notes
- GPT-5 streaming works differently than GPT-4o - need to test thoroughly
- MCP tools are dynamically loaded - ensure proper error handling
- Document state must be included in every query after edits

---

## üö® Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None

### Dependencies
- **n8n MCP Server**: Must be running and accessible
- **Notion API Access**: Required for publishing
- **GPT-5 API Access**: Ensure API key has GPT-5 permissions
